 * FrwsssMsuR()
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function is like frdssdMsu() but WITH Rounding applied to the 
 *   subtractor result before it is saturated and the top 16-bits taken.
 *   This function first multiplies the two 16-bit input values 'b x c' which 
 *   results in a 32-bit value.  This result is left shifted by one to account 
 *   for the extra sign bit inherent in the fractional-type multiply. So, the
 *   shifted number now has a '0' in the Lsb. The shifted multiplier output
 *   is then SUBTRACTED from the 32-bit fractional input 'a'. Then the 32-bits
 *   output from this subtraction are rounded by adding '2^15'.  This value 
 *   is then saturated to be within the Fract16 range.  
 *   It is assumed that the binary point of the 32-bit input value a is in
 *   the same bit position as the shifted multiplier output.
 *   The frdsssMsuR() function is for fractional Qtype format data only and
 *   it therefore will not give the correct results for true integers. 
 * 
 *   This function relates to the ETSI msu_r function.
 *
 * Arguments:
 *   Fract32 a
 *     [in]  32-bit 32-bit Value which is subtracted from
 *   Fract16 b
 *     [in]  16-bit multiplication operand 1
 *   Fract16 c
 *     [in]  16-bit multiplication operand 2
 *
 * Return Value:
 *   Fract16 result
 *     [return] 16-bit
