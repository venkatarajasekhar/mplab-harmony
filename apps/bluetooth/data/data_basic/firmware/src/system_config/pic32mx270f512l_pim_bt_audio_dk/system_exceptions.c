  MPLAB Harmony Exceptions Source File

  File Name:
    system_exceptions.c

  Summary:
    This file contains a function which overrides the deafult _weak_ exception 
    handler provided by the XC32 compiler.

  Description:
    This file redefines the default _weak_  exception handler with a more debug
    friendly one. If an unexpected exception occurs the code will stop in a
    while(1) loop.  The debugger can be halted and two variables _excep_code and
    _except_addr can be examined to determine the cause and address where the
    exception occured.
