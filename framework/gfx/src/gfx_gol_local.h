/*******************************************************************************
 Module for Microchip Graphics Library - Graphic Object Layer

  Company:
    Microchip Technology Inc.

  File Name:
    gfx_gol_local.h

  Summary:
    Graphics Object Layer of the Microchip Graphics Library.

  Description:
    This module implements the common routines for the Graphics Object Layer
    of the Microchip Graphics Library. The routines are independent of the
    Display Driver Layer and should be compatible with any Display Driver
    that is compliant with the requirements of the Display Driver
    Layer of the Graphics Library.
    The module utilizes the Graphics Primitive Layer to render the objects.
