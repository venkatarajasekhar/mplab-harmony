/* SQI Driver Command Handle

  Summary:
    Identies a read or a write request queued to the SQI driver.

  Description:
    A command handle is returned by a call to the DRV_SQI_Read() or
    DRV_SQI_Write() functions. This handle allows the application to track the
    completion of the request. This command handle is also returned to the
    client along with the event that has occurred with respect to the request.
    This allows the application to connect the event to a specific command
    request in case where multiple commands are queued.

    The command handle associated with the command request expires when the
    client has been notified of the completion of the command (after event
    handler function that notifies the client returns) or after the command has
    been retired by the driver if no event handler callback was set. 

  Remarks:
    None.

   Description:
    This data type defines the required function signature for the SQI driver
    command event handling callback function. A client must register a pointer
    to a command event handling function the signature(parameter and return
    value types) of which should match the types specified by this function
    pointer in order to receive command related event callbacks from the
    driver.

    The parameters and return values and return value are described here and
    a partial example implementation is provided.

  Parameters:
    event           - Identifies the type of event

    commandHandle   - Handle identifying the command to which this event
                      relates

    context         - Value identifying the context of the application that
                      registered the event handling function.

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
    void MyAppCommandEventHandler
    (
        DRV_SQI_EVENT event,
        DRV_SQI_COMMAND_HANDLE commandHandle,
        uintptr_t context
    )
    {
        MY_APP_DATA_STRUCT pAppData = (MY_APP_DATA_STRUCT)context;

        switch(event)
        {
            case DRV_SQI_EVENT_COMMAND_COMPLETE:
                // Handle the completed command.
                break;

            case DRV_SQI_EVENT_COMMAND_ERROR:
            default:
                // Handle error.
                break;
        }
    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    If the event is DRV_SQI_EVENT_COMMAND_COMPLETE, that the operation
    associated with the command was completed successfully.
    If the event is DRV_SQI_EVENT_COMMAND_ERROR, there was an error while
    executing the command request.

    The context parameter contains context details provided by the client as
    part of registering the event handler function.  This context value is
    passed back to the client as the "context" parameter. It can be any value
    necessary to identify the client context or instance (such as a pointer to
    the client's data) of the client that made the request.

    DRV_SQI_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle.

  Parameters:
    handle       - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's
                   open routine

  Returns:
    None

  Example:
    <code>
    DRV_HANDLE handle;  // Returned from DRV_SQI_Open

    DRV_SQI_Close(handle);
    </code>

  Remarks:
    After calling this routine, the handle passed in "handle" must not be used
    with any of the remaining driver routines. A new handle must be obtained by
    calling DRV_SQI_Open before the caller may use the driver again. Usually
    there is no need for the driver client to verify that the Close operation
    has completed.

    );

  Summary:
    Queue a data transfer operation on the specified SQI device.

  Description:
    This routine queues a data transfer operation on the specified SQI device.
    The reads or writes of blocks of data generally involves sending down the
    read or a write command, the address on the device from/to which data is to
    be read/written. The client also has to specify the source or destination
    buffer and the number of bytes to be read or written. The client builds an
    array of transfer elements containing these information and passes the
    array and the number of elements of the array as part of this transfer
    operation. If an event handler is registered with the driver the event
    handler would be invoked with the status of the operation once the
    operation has been completed. The function returns
    DRV_SQI_COMMAND_HANDLE_INVALID in the commandHandle argument under the
    following circumstances:
    - if the driver handle is invalid
    - if the transfer element is NULL or number of transfer elements is zero
    - if a buffer object could not be allocated to the request

  Precondition:
    The DRV_SQI_Initialize routine must have been called for the specified SQI 
    driver instance.

    DRV_SQI_Open must have been called with DRV_IO_INTENT_READ or
    DRV_IO_INTENT_READWRITE as the ioIntent to obtain a valid opened device
    handle.

  Parameters:
    handle        - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's
                    open function

    commandHandle - Pointer to an argument that will contain the return buffer
                    handle

    sqiDevice     - The SQI device index on which the operation is to be
                    performed.
                   
    xferData      - Pointer to the transfer elements array.

    numElements   - Number of elements in the transfer elements array.

  Returns:
    The handle to the command request is returned in the commandHandle
    argument. It will be DRV_SQI_COMMAND_HANDLE_INVALID if the request was not
    successful.

  Example:
    <code>
    #define READ_BUF_SIZE 512

    uint8_t readBuffer[READ_BUF_SIZE] __attribute__((coherent, aligned(16)));
    uint8_t command [5] __attribute__((coherent, aligned(16)) = {0x0B, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x0FF};
    uint8_t numElements = 0;
    DRV_SQI_COMMAND_HANDLE commandHandle;
    MY_APP_OBJ myAppObj;
    DRV_SQI_TransferElement xferData[2];

    // mySQIHandle is the handle returned by the DRV_SQI_Open function.
    // Setup the transfer elements.
    
    xferData[0].data = &command[0];
    xferData[0].length = sizeof(command);
    xferData[0].flag = (DRV_SQI_FLAG_MODE_SINGLE_LANE);

    xferData[1].length = READ_BUF_SIZE;
    xferData[1].flag = (DRV_SQI_FLAG_MODE_QUAD_LANE | DRV_SQI_FLAG_DIR_READ | DRV_SQI_FLAG_DEASSERT_CS);

    DRV_SQI_TransferData(mySQIHandle, &commandHandle, 0, xferData, 2);

    );

  Summary:
    Gets the current status of the command.

  Description:
    This routine gets the current status of the command. The application must
    use this routine where the status of a scheduled command needs to polled
    on. The function may return DRV_SQI_COMMAND_COMPLETED in a case where
    the command handle has expired. A command handle expires when the internal
    buffer object is re-assigned to another read/write request. It is
    recommended that this function be called regularly in order to track the
    command status correctly.

    The application can alternatively register an event handler to receive the
    read/write operation completion events.

  Preconditions:
    The DRV_SQI_Initialize() routine must have been called.

    The DRV_SQI_Open() must have been called to obtain a valid opened device
    handle.

  Parameters:
    handle - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's open
             routine

  Returns:
    A DRV_SQI_COMMAND_STATUS value describing the current status of the
    command. Returns DRV_SQI_COMMAND_ERROR_UNKNOWN if the client handle or the
    command handle is not valid.

  Example:
    <code>
    DRV_HANDLE                  handle;         // Returned from DRV_SQI_Open
    DRV_SQI_COMMAND_HANDLE      commandHandle;

  Remarks:
    This routine will not block for hardware access and will immediately return
    the current status.

    );

  Summary:
    Allows a client to identify an event handling function for the driver to
    call back when queued operation has completed.

  Description:
    This function allows a client to identify an event handling function for
    the driver to call back when queued operation has completed. When a client
    calls read or a write function, it is provided with a handle identifying
    the command that was added to the driver's buffer queue.  The driver will
    pass this handle back to the client by calling "eventHandler" function when
    the queued operation has completed.
    
    The event handler should be set before the client performs any read or
    write operations that could generate events. The event handler once set,
    persists until the client closes the driver or sets another event handler
    (which could be a "NULL" pointer to indicate no callback).

  Precondition:
    The DRV_SQI_Initialize() routine must have been called for the specified
    SQI driver instance.

    The DRV_SQI_Open() routine must have been called to obtain a valid opened
    device handle.

  Parameters:
    handle       - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's
                   open function

    eventHandler - Pointer to the event handler function implemented by the
                   user
    
    context      - The value of parameter will be passed back to the client 
                   unchanged, when the eventHandler function is called. It can
                   be used to identify any client specific data object that 
                   identifies the instance of the client module (for example, 
                   it may be a pointer to the client module's state structure).

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
    // myAppObj is an application specific state data object.
    MY_APP_OBJ myAppObj;

    DRV_SQI_TransferElement xferElements[2];
    DRV_SQI_COMMAND_HANDLE commandHandle;

    // drvSQIHandle is the handle returned by the DRV_SQI_Open function.
    // Client registers an event handler with driver. This is done once.
    DRV_SQI_EventHandlerSet(drvSQIHandle, APP_SQIEventHandler, (uintptr_t)&myAppObj);

    DRV_SQI_Read(drvSQIHandle, &commandHandle, &xferElements, 2);

    if(DRV_SQI_COMMAND_HANDLE_INVALID == commandHandle)
    {
        // Error handling here
    }

    // Event handler.
    void APP_SQIEventHandler
    (
        DRV_SQI_EVENT event, 
        DRV_SQI_COMMAND_HANDLE handle,
        uintptr_t context
    )
    {
        // The context handle was set to an application specific object. It is
        // now retrievable easily in the event handler.
        MY_APP_OBJ myAppObj = (MY_APP_OBJ *) context;

        switch(event)
        {
            case DRV_SQI_EVENT_COMMAND_COMPLETE:
                // This means the operation was completed successfully.
                break;
            
            case DRV_SQI_EVENT_COMMAND_ERROR:
                // Operation failed. Handle the error.
                break;

            default:
                break;
        }
    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    If the client does not want to be notified when the queued operation has
    completed, it does not need to register a callback.
