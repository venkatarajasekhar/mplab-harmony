Welcome to the MPLAB Harmony Integrated Software Framework!Your installation is almost complete. Only a few steps remain.  MPLAB Harmony provides a powerful graphical project configurstion tool, the MPLAB Harmony Configurator (MHC), which is a MPLAB X IDE plug-in module.Installing this plug-in will add the MPLAB Harmony Configurator selection to the Tools > Embedded menu in the MPLAB X IDE.  It will also add the MPLAB Harmony Project project type to the Microchip Embedded category of projects in the MPLAB X IDE New Project wizard.  The MHC is your quickest and easiest way to create and configure MPLAB Harmony projects.If you already have the MPLAB X IDE installed on your system, you will need toopen it and install the MHC plug-in.  The latest version of the MHC is always available on the Microchip Plug-ins server.  To locate and install it, followthese steps.1. From the MPLAB X IDE Tools menu, choose Plugins.  A dialog box appears.2. Select the Available Plugins tab and locate MPLAB Harmony Configurator    from the list of available plug-ins.   Note:  If the MPLAB Harmony Configurator does not appear in the list of    available plug-ins, click Check for Newest.3. Ensure that the install option for the MHC plug-in is selected.4. Click Install and follow the on-screen directions.   Note: You may need to restart MPLAB X IDE for the plug-in to become active.If you are using an older version of MPLAB Harmony and want to use the version of the MHC plug-in module that was released with that version, you can locate the MHC plug-in module file in the installation within the following directory:   <install-dir>/utilities/mhc/com-microchip-mplab-modules-mhc.nbm      Where <install-dir> refers to the MPLAB Harmony installation path, which by    default is one of the following:      * Windows: C:/microchip/harmony/<version>   * Mac OS or Linux: ~/microchip/harmony/<version>To install the MHC plug-in module from the MPLAB Harmony installation instead of from the server, you can use the Downloaded tab in the Plug-ins dialog, navigate to the plug-in file, and then click Add Plugins.  Then, complete the installation structions from step 2.Refer to the MPLAB Harmony Help for additional information.  If you are not using the MPLAB X IDE or have not yet installed it, you still have access to the full MPLAB Harmony Help, as it is provided in three formats:   * Adobe Portable Document Format (.pdf)   * HyperText Markup Language (.html, utilized by the MHC for context-based help.)   * Microsoft Compiled HTML Help (.chm)These help files are available in your installation of MPLAB Harmony within the <install-dir>/doc directory.Enjoy!
